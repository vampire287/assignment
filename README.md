# assignment
An app for an assignment.
Approach:I used custom appBar to implement two icon buttons at the side of the subtitle, and used columns,row and containers to implement the arrangement of elements.
I also used mediaQuery to implement responsiveness to the app for landscape mode and portrait mode.The buttons at top in landscape mode and at the bottom in portrait mode navigates out of the app(left icon button) and to the next page(no layout)(right icon button) respectively.
